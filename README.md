# Basic AWS Practical Projects

Welcome to my repository of basic practical projects for AWS. This repository contains a collection of projects designed to help you learn and practice using various services and functionalities provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Each project is accompanied by step-by-step instructions for easy implementation.

## Project Overview

These projects are tailored to teach you different aspects of AWS, from database management to security, networking, and serverless applications. The goal is to provide hands-on experience and deepen your understanding of AWS cloud solutions.

## Prerequisites

Before working on these projects, ensure you have:

- An active AWS account.
- Basic knowledge of the AWS Management Console and `AWS CLI`.
- Familiarity with programming and cloud computing concepts.
